# BinomialCoefficient
[Binomial coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient) are the positive intergers that occurs as coefficients in the binomial theorem

Recursive Function Explain 
=
Recursive function is a function that calls itself.
The if-else statement defines when the function should return a value and when it should call itself

Depth of recursion is the number of times a function calls itself
